### 1. Recitation Exercises

These exercises are to be found in: **Introduction to Statistical Learning,
7th Printing (Online Edition)** by *Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor
Hastie, Robert Tibshirani*.

### 1.1 Chapter 3:

Exercises: 1,3,4

### 1.2 Chapter 4:

Exercises: 4,6,7,9

### 2.  Practicum Problems

These problems will primarily reference the *lecture materials and the examples
given in class* using **R** and **CRAN**. It is suggested that a *RStudio* session be
used for the programmatic components.

### 2.1 Problem 1: 

Load the *Boston* sample dataset into R using a dataframe (it is part of the
MASS package). Use lm to fit a regression between *medv* and *lstat* - plot the
resulting fit and show a plot of fitted values vs. residuals. Is there a possible
non-linear relationship between the predictor and response? Use the **predict**
function to calculate values response values for *lstat* of 5, 10, and 15 - obtain
confidence intervals as well as prediction intervals for the results - are they the
same? Why or why not? Modify the regression to include *lstat^2* (as well *lstat*
itself) and compare the *R^2* between the linear and non-linear fit - use **ggplot2**
and *stat_smooth* to plot the relationship.

### 2.2 Problem 2: 

Load the *abalone* sample dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository
(**abalone.data**) into **R** using a dataframe. Remove all observations in the
Infant category, keeping the Male/Female classes. Using the **caret** package, use
*createDataPartition* to perform an 80/20 test-train split (80% training and 20%
testing). Fit a logistic regression using all feature variables via **glm**, and observe
which predictors are relevant. Do the confidence intervals for the predictors 
contain 0 within the range? How does this relate to the null hypothesis? Use the
*confusionMatrix* function in **caret** to observe testing results (use a 50% cutoff to
tag Male/Female) - how does the accuracy compare to a random classifier ROC
curve? Use the **corrplot** package to plot correlations between the predictors.
How does this help explain the classifier performance?

### 2.3 Problem 3:

Load the *mushroom* sample dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository
(**agaricus-lepiota.data**) into **R** using a dataframe (**Note**: There are missing
values with a *?* character, you will have to explain your handling of these).
Create a Naive Bayes classifier using the **e1071** package, using the *sample* function 
to split the data between 80% for training and 20% for testing. With the
target class of interest being *edible* mushrooms, calculate the accuracy of the
classifier both in-training and in-test. Use the table function to create a con-
fusion matrix of predicted vs. actual classes - how many false positives did the
model produce?

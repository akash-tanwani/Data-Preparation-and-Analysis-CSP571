### 1. Recitation Exercises

These exercises are to be found in: **Introduction to Statistical Learning, 7th Printing (Online Edition)** by Gareth James, 
Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani.

### 1.1 Chapter 2

Exercises: 1,2,4,6,7

### 2. Practicum Problems

These problems will primarily reference the lecture materials and the examples
given in class using R and CRAN. It is suggested that a RStudio session be
used for the programmatic components.

### 2.1  Problem 1: 
Load the iris sample dataset into **R** using a dataframe (it is a built-in dataset).
Create a boxplot of each of the 4 features, and highlight the feature with the
largest empirical ***IQR***. Calculate the parametric standard deviation for each
feature - do your results agree with the empirical values? Use the ***ggplot2*** library
from **CRAN** to create a colored boxplot for each feature, with a box-whisker
per ower species. Which ower type exhibits a signicantly dierent ***Petal
Length/Width*** once it is separated from the other classes?

### 2.2 Problem 2:
Load the trees sample dataset into **R** using a dataframe (it is a built-in dataset),
and produce a 5-number summary of each feature. Create a histogram of each
variable - which variables appear to be normally distributed based on visual
inspection? Do any variables exhibit positive or negative skewness? Install
the ***moments*** library from **CRAN** use the ***skewness*** function to calculate the
skewness of each variable. Do the values agree with the visual inspection?

### 2.3 Problem 3:
Load the auto-mpg sample dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (**auto-mpg.data**) into R using a dataframe 
(**Hint**: You will need to use ***read.csv*** with url, and set the appropriate values for **header,as.is**, and **sep**).
The ***horsepower*** feature has a few missing values with a **?** - and will be treated
as a string. Use the ***as.numeric*** casting function to obtain the column as a nu-
meric vector, and replace all NA values with the median. How does this aect
the value obtained for the mean vs the original mean when the records were
ignored?
